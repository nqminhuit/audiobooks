Chapter one. Mr Sherlock Holmes.

00:00:04,383 --> 00:00:17,191
In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army.

3
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:25,337
Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon.

4
00:00:25,337 --> 00:00:33,106
The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out.

5
00:00:33,106 --> 00:00:41,876
On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemyâ€™s country.

6
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:56,676
I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties.
